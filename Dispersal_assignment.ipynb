    "Let's imagine that we're behavioral ecologists interested in how individuals of some species move around a landscape. To keep things simple at the beginning, we can think about the landscape as a grid of cells (the actual size of our cells would obviously depend on what species we're interested in). Our null model is that each individual moves in a random direction (up, down, left, or right) for a fixed distance (1 grid cell) each day. We'd like to run a simulation to help us gain some intuition for the predictions of our model regarding how far away each individual might be from where they started after a certain number of days."
